In July 2017 Patricia Aas started tweeting questions on the IT security of the ballot counting computer system to the Norwegian Election Directorate. Since the directorate has been largely unresponsive when not prompted by the media, this site has been set up to collect all information that has been uncovered. It will also continue to post relevant information so that anyone wishing to learn more can find it all in one place.
